* Advent of Code 2020
I am not a lisp programmer, rather a lisp learner. My plan is to solve
each of the puzzles myself (as far as possible), then review other
submissions and refactor my code accordingly (with credit to sources
of better solutions).
Many thanks to everyone sharing their code on github - much
appreciated!
