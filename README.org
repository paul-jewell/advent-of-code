* Advent of Code Solutions
I have had a go at the Advent of Code problems over the last few
years, to a greater or lesser extent depending on how busy I have
been. I have now brought the different repositories into this one
repository, and future development will be carried out in here. I
think there are some earlier efforts - I will have a look, and if
there is anything substantial, then I will add them here.

* Purpose
Advent of Code for me is an opportunity to learn about a programming
language. The code in the solutions is not exemplary, or good examples
of using these languages. You are free to use the code as you see fit,
but you also get to keep the bugs therein! In the repository I have used the following languages to a
greater or lesser extent:

** Clojure
** Lisp
** (2023) - Rust
